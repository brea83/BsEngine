from reviewing engine reading and talks

Application should be separate from Core engine

most do this with multiple cpp projects

Core Engine should be the reusable parts
	Main Loop
	Window system
	Renderer
	Event system

	layer and application systems? need to read more about what they mean by this
		layer is a way to introduce custom behavior

App project should contain
	app specific code [like imgui for editor app]?


App project main file is simple calls to engine core project stuff


ToDos:
separate application and editor stuff from core stuff
console/debug log in editor views
plan and prepare for at least some threading



Threading strategy that I used in the dots project
main thread would thread collision
wait for those to be done
then thread the gameobject update and "pre render" 
	(if a dot was still alive after its update it sent its rendering data 
	to the renderer to be added to a pixel buffer)
after the threaded updates are complete the main loop tells the renderer to send the pixel buffer to the gpu to render the screen



the dots engine did not respond to user input...
	so for my engine I need to consider: 
	if an event happens mid threaded update what do I want to happen?
	Collect that event data to be processed after all the threading has completed
	then distribute it to appropriate systems before threading happens again?


	Systems I want or need in my engine

Window/application level system, interfaces with hardware and raises events to the engine
Rendering system for gameplay visuals
system for editor and debug ui (thanks Imgui for making this part easy)
system for simulating playmode in editor
audio system
serialization of assets, levels, and editor/gameplay settings
